• SSH to a remote machine without a password
   ◦ Generate SSH key pairs on local machine
      ◦ Create .ssh dir in the $HOME: mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
      ◦ Change .ssh permission: chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh
      ◦ Generate key pairs using ssh key tool: ssh-keygen
         ▸ Follow the prompt
         ▸ This should result in two files: $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa and $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      ◦ Copy public key to the remote machine: scp $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <user>@<remote>:<path>
   ◦ Append public key to the authorized keychain on remote machine
      ◦ Create .ssh dir on remote: mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
      ◦ Change permission: chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh
      ◦ Append uploaded public key to authorized_keys: cat <path>/id_ras.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
      ◦ Change permission for authorized_keys: chmod 0600 $HOME./.ssh/authorized_keys
   ◦ SSH to the remote machine on local machine
      ◦ ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/.id_rsa <user>@<remote>
      ◦ An optional alias can be created for future shortcut: alias ssh<name>=’ssh -2 -x <user>@<remote>’
