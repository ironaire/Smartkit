                                     * * *


•Generate SSH key pairs on local machine
   ◦ Create .ssh dir if not existing: mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
   ◦ Change permission for .ssh: chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh
   ◦ Generate key pairs: ssh-keygen
      ◦ Follow the prompt
      ◦ This should result in two files
         ▸ $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa(private key)
         ▸ $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub(public key)
      ◦ Copy public key to the remote machine: scp $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
          <user>@<host>:<path>
•Append public key to the authorized keychain on remote machine
   ◦ Create .ssh dir if not existing: mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
   ◦ Change permission for .ssh: chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh
   ◦ Append uploaded public key to the authorized_key: \
      cat <path>/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ◦ Change permission for authorized_keys: \
      chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
•SSH to the remote machine on local machine
   ◦ ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa <user>@<host>
   ◦ An alias can be created for future shortcut: \
      alias ssh<name>=’ssh -2 -x <user>@<host>’
